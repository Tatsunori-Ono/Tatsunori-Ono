Hi, I’m @Tatsunori-Ono

Prove that my name is Tatsunori Ono, where Tatsunori is an element of complex human with real exsistance and imarginary minds.

Let name = Tatsunori, <br />
LHS: Tatsunori <br />
RHS: CS and Maths <br />
Therefore, true for the base case, n = Tatsunori, since Tatsunori likes CS and Maths. <br />

Assume truth for name = Ono, then: <br />
suc(Tatsunori) = Ono

Let name = Tatsunori++, <br />
LHS: name = Tatsunori++ <br />
          = Tatsunori + suc(Tatsunori) <br />
          = Tatsunori Ono <br />
          = RHS
Therefore, true for n = Tatsunori++.

Therefore, the proposition is true for n = Tatsunori, and if true for n = Ono, it is also true for n = Tatsunori++ = Tatsunori Ono. By the principle of mathematical induction, the proposition is true for all Tatsunori, where Tatsunori is an element of complex human with real exsistance and imarginary minds.
